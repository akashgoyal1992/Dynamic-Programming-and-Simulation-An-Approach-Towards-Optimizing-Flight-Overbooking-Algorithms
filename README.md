In this project, we are going to delve into one such problem of optimizing airline revenue through strategic overbooking, using dynamic programming to find the optimal balance between selling tickets and managing overbooking risks to maximize expected discounted profit. We analyzed different overbooking policies for a flight with coach and first-class seats, exploring scenarios from 5 to 15 additional passengers in coach, while considering costs associated with upgrading or denying boarding. An alternative strategy allowed halting coach sales on demand, offering a more flexible approach to managing seat capacity. Through simulations, we assessed the financial implications and operational impacts of each policy, identifying the most profitable strategies and comparing overbooking approaches with detailed quantitative insights and visualizations, aimed at informing future revenue optimization strategies.
